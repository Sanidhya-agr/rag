The biggest shift.
Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act)
This law changed how NDAs are drafted.
Now NDAs often include:
•	Personal data handling obligations
•	Data breach reporting requirements
•	Processing limitations
•	Security safeguards
•	Cross-border data clauses
Freelancers handling user data now have statutory liability, not just contractual.
That’s huge.


⚖️ 3. Gig Economy Recognition
Through:
•	Code on Social Security, 2020
Gig workers and platform workers gained legal recognition.
Impact on NDAs:
•	Clear classification clauses
•	Independent contractor declarations
•	Liability allocation language
•	No employer-employee relationship statements
Companies want to avoid “disguised employment” claims.

4. Intellectual Property Ownership Awareness
Post-startup boom, NDAs expanded to include:
•	Work-for-hire clauses
•	IP assignment
•	Moral rights waivers
•	Portfolio usage permissions
Because freelancers often create:
•	Designs
•	Software
•	Content
•	Branding assets
Ownership disputes increased — so contracts evolved.
